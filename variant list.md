# Variant list

This list is adapted from the one published by UKHSA at [https://github.com/phe-genomics/variant_definitions/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/phe-genomics/variant_definitions/blob/main/README.md) and is for my personal use only.

| Label                  | Lineages              | Description                             |
