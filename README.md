# Andrew's Dorset covid statistics

This is the output of me playing around with the R statistical programming language and the coronavirus data produced on a daily basis by Public Health England and published at [https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk).

I'm publishing these interpretations of data already in the public domain purely for my personal interest. They're updated when I feel like it, and you should always check the dates on the data plots to see how old they are. To see the most up-to date information you should always check Public Health England's dashboard at [https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk). I am not a statistician or an epidemiologist, or any kind of expert in this field. **This information is offered on a best endeavours basis for your own interest and you should not use it for any other purpose.**

If you find these statistics of interest you may also enjoy my blog posts on [generating the R code behind the England case rates plot](https://www.ajharrison.org.uk/2021/05/03/interpreting-covid-case-rates-with-r/), and the [importance of working with 'long data' as opposed to 'wide data'](https://www.ajharrison.org.uk/2021/05/22/converting-wide-data-into-long-with-r/).
